On 9th May, I registered for COVID vaccination using the CoWIN app. Through the app was not perfect, it has done it's job and I along with my cousin registered for vaccine in a village ( 25 KM far) near Motihari (Bihar), the place I am currently working. On 10th morning, we went to the vaccination place and we were just asked for phone number and our turn for vaccination came and everything went great.

At the spot of vaccination, the nurse opened the seal of 5 ml vial, took around 0.75 ml, trashed 0.25 ml to make it 0.5 ml and injected it. Little explanation was done. Then came my cousin's turn. I expected them to use the remaining bottle. But to my surprise, they opened a seal of new bottle and repeated the same process. Though I am not 100% sure if the remaining will be wasted or if the design is that way, or since the place has few people, the wastages, it raised so many questions on inefficiencies. 

Later that day, I read the following,

"Each 5 ml vial of the vaccine has 10 doses in total. And, once opened, all 10 doses have to be consumed within four hours, otherwise, it goes waste, and the remaining doses have to be destroyed," RGSSH spokesperson Chhavi Gupta told PTI. 


While Delhi is begging for more share of vaccines, operational inefficiencies are wasting vaccines in rural places. And this is frustrating. 

Why the vials are kept in 5 ml bottles instead of 1 ml bottle ? Why didn't we bother to change the design ? And infinite similar questions.
