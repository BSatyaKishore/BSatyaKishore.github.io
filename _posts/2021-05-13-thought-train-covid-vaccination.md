On 9th May, I register for COVID vaccination using the CoWIN app. Through the app was not perfect, it has done it's job and I along with my cousin registered for vaccine in a village ( 25 KM far) near Motihari, I place I am currently working. On 10th morning, we went to the vaccination place and we were asked for phone number and everything went great.

At the spot of vaccination, the nurse opened the seal of 5 ml vial and took around 0.75 ml and trashed 0.25 ml and injected the rest 0.5 ml. Then came my cousins turn. I expected them to use the remaining bottle. But to my surprise, the opened the seal of a new bottle and did the same. Though I am not 100% sure of the remaining be wasted or if the design is that way, or since it is a deserted place and people don't come there thus there's no choice except for the remaining to be wasted, it raised so many questions on inefficiencies. 

Later that day, I read the following,

```
"Each 5 ml vial of the vaccine has 10 doses in total. And, once opened, all 10 doses have to be consumed within four hours, otherwise, it goes waste, and the remaining doses have to be destroyed," RGSSH spokesperson Chhavi Gupta told PTI. 
```

While Delhi is begging for more share of vaccines, operational inefficiencies are wasting vaccines in rural places. And this is frustrating. And why the vials are kept in 5 ml bottles instead of 1 ml bottle ? Why didn't we bother to change the design ? And infinite similar questions.
