We all might have heard something like a plastic once produced will take 1000s of years to leave the planet. A lot of us are scared to use plastic. But do we need to be scared to use plastic? In this blog, I write about my understanding of plastic's production, plastic recycling which include thermal recycling, using it in roads, PET bottle recycling and my thought train on how to stop plastic from oceans.

### Thermal Recycling: 
###### Writing information from what I heard from people who are in this field. Still need to verify this and add citations.

Plastic is mostly made of hydrogen & carbon and thus can be a fuel. But when burnt at temperatures less than 1000° C, the plastic emits carcinogens. When burnt above 1000° C, it emits CO2 and water like all fuels (hydrocarbons). A 1000° C might seem to be difficult to build infrastructure to build in developing countries but there are several factories which burn coals or fuel to get temperatures to that which include cement factories, thermal power stations, steel plants. 

But, plastic comes with everything including clothes, medicines, electronics, solar panels, toys, also adding to this, plastic waste can be soiled. Still need to study if  plastic with these materials can be thermally recycled with out a lot of investment. Also, need to study how much investment or challenges these factories have to burn plastic.
